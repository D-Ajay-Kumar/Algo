## ⭐ Contributing Guidelines
- Plagiarism is strictly not allowed. Any work that is found to be suspicious of plagiarized work will not be merged.
- Issues will be assigned to those who create them unless the author wants someone else to take it. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit.
- You cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- In case you want to submit an improvement to an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue describing in detail about your improvement. This will help others to analyze your contribution.
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- All PRs must be made from a different branch. Create a separate branch for every issue you are working on and once found fit, make a PR.

Make sure your code works before submitting it.

<h2 id="Stepstofollow"> ⭐ Steps to follow :scroll:</h2>

<br>

### 0️⃣ Code of conduct

Please read our [Code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which stipulates explicitly that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. This also documents our conflict resolution policy.

### 1️⃣ Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [Algo](https://github.com/R-n-D-PEC-CSS/Algo) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button.

<br>


### 2️⃣ Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Algo.git
```

> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `Algo` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder Algo
$ cd Algo
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

<br>



### 3️⃣ Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Algo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Algo.git (push)
```
Now, lets add a reference to the original [Algo](https://github.com/R-n-D-PEC-CSS/Algo) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/R-n-D-PEC-CSS/Algo.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Algo.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Algo.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/R-n-D-PEC-CSS/Algo.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/R-n-D-PEC-CSS/Algo.git (push)
```

<br>



### 4️⃣ Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `Algo` repo
$ git push origin master
```

<br>



### 5️⃣ Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our `Help Wanted` Issues and creating [pull requests](https:/R-n-D-PEC-CSS/Algo/github.com//pulls).

<br>

### 6️⃣ Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to make contribution. Please create seperate branch using command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to branch Folder_Name
$ git checkout -b Folder_Name
```

Create a seperate branch for contibution and try to use same name of branch as of folder.

To switch to desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout Folder_Name
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch Folder_Name
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reveiwer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

<br>


### 8️⃣ Share your work :star_struck:

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Folder_Name
```

Then, go to your repository in browser and click on `compare and pull requests`.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.
